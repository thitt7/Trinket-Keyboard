# Trinket-Keyboard
The objective of this project is to create a DIY usb ducky script that works with the Adafruit Trinket due to its conveniently small size and form factor. There are many commercially available solutions for this type of device but these can cost upwards of $50 USD. Many novice ethical hackers don't have the income to spend on devices like this, so this project strives to achieve similar results piecing together the Adafruit Trinket, routinely purchased for ~$5 USD, with a Micro USB OTG adapter of your choice so as to keep the cost down and make it more affordable to get a hands on learning experience with a USB ducky.
